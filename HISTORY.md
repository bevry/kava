## v3.1.0 2018 November 19

-   Added minimal TypeScript types for common usage

## v3.0.0 2018 November 19

-   Renamed from `joe` to `kava`
    -   To upgrade `npm install --save-dev kava` then `npm uninstall --save-dev joe joe-reporter-console joe-reporter-list`
    -   Credit to [Sam Holmes](https://github.com/samholmes) for the `kava` package name
-   Added [Technical API Documentation](http://master.kava.bevry.surge.sh/docs/)
    -   Closes [issue #12](https://github.com/bevry/kava/issues/12)
-   Changed the way adding reporters work
    -   As a consumer, you can now specify custom configuration to `addReporter`
    -   As a reporter author, the kava instance is now sent via the configuration, rather than applied to the instance after the constructor
-   Errors in Error Logs are now named `error` instead of `err`
-   Removed the need to install reporters separately
    -   This is enabled because the following repositories have been inlined:
        -   [joe-examples](https://github.com/bevry/joe-examples)
        -   [joe-reporter-console](https://github.com/bevry/joe-reporter-console)
        -   [joe-reporter-list](https://github.com/bevry/joe-reporter-list)
    -   The console reporter is once again the default, allowing you to avoid having to manually specify the reporter to use
    -   Reporters can still be changed via the environment variable, now named `KAVA_REPORTER`
    -   Changing reporters via command line arguments is no longer supported for simplicity's sake
-   Fixed `hasReporters` not working
    -   Closes [pull request #23](https://github.com/bevry/joe/pull/23) thanks to [Robert de Forest](https://github.com/rdeforest)
-   Updated [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base) and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v2.0.2 2016 November 4

-   Fixed `--joe-reporter=console` not working (regression since v2.0.0)
-   Fixed early node compatibility properly (initial attempt was in v2.0.0)

## v2.0.1 2016 November 4

-   Fixed tests not being published to npm for use in the testing ecosystem

## v2.0.0 2016 November 4

This release contains several major improvements to internals and undocumented functionality, which potentially impact backwards compatibility with before and after hooks, and reporter functionality. For the average end-user these should be non-functional changes and should just improve the quality of the reports that joe generates.

-   The before and after hooks are now stable and documented - `before` and `after` listers fire with the context as the item they are bound to, receiving no arguments besides the optional completion callback
    -   `task.before`, `task.after`, `suite.before`, `suite.after` listeners fire with the context as the suite they are bound to, receiving the first argument as the item for the hook, as well as the optional completion callback
-   Suite initialiser methods now get descriptive names instead of no name
-   If a suite or test encounter an error, the `finish[Test|Suite]` reporting now always occurs regardless of `reporting` preference
-   The global suite now has a name of `global joe suite`, it is up to the reporters to filter this out
-   Reporter can now be specified via the `JOE_REPORTER` environment variable
-   Reporter must now be specified, no longer defaults to `joe-reporter-console`
-   `--joe-reporter` and `JOE_REPORTER` can now point to paths to load
-   `setReporter` now expects to receive a reporter instance
-   Exit reporting now contains the reason for the exit as the second argument
-   `getItemName` has now been removed, it should be handled by the reporters instead
-   `uncaughtException` method has been removed, it doesn't make sense being an API call
-   Simplified cross environment (browser, windows, etc) handling
-   Exiting should now be more reliable across different node versions and browser environments
    -   browsers will now have exit reporting by waiting for the global suite to destroy
    -   on node
        -   joe will now listen to `beforeExit` so exits can perform more reliably
        -   joe will no longer bother with `SIGINT` on windows as `beforeExit` should now accomplish that
        -   joe will no longer listen to the global suites completion event to exit, now it just listens to the `beforeExit`, `exit`, and `uncaughtException` events
            -   this is groundwork to solving [issue #19](https://github.com/bevry/joe/issues/19) (a regression since v1.8.0)
-   Early node version support added once again without the need of a polyfill
-   Moved examples out from this repository into the new [`joe-examples` repository](https://github.com/bevry/joe-examples)
-   Testing infrastructure now tests the most common reporters against the most common examples
-   Updated base files

## v1.8.0 2016 June 4

-   Converted from CoffeeScript to ESNext

## v1.7.0 2016 June 4

-   Updated for TaskGroup v5 and EventEmitterGrouped v2.5.0
-   Updated internal conventions

## v1.6.1 2017 March 29

-   Prevent usage with Event Emitter Grouped v2.5.0 as its ES6 class does not give us the prototype fields we need to mix it into our classes - Changes semver of it from `^2.4.3` to `~2.4.3` - So this release fixes the following issue (which we were encountering with DocPad v6.79 which uses Joe v1.6.0):

        		```
        		$ npm test

        		> joe@1.6.0 test /Users/balupton/Projects/active/joe
        		> node out/test/joe-test.js

        		/Users/balupton/Projects/active/joe/out/lib/joe.js:186
        				this.emitSerial('before', (function(_this) {
        						^

        		TypeError: this.emitSerial is not a function

        		THE ABOVE IS -->NOT<-- WHAT WE EXPECTED. TESTS HAVE FAILED

        		```
